# Vancouver Commerce Density Data Analysis

In this project we are trying to solve the problem of finding parts of Vancouver that contain relatively higher amounts of chain restaurants compared to non-chain restaurants. This data can give valuable information and a tool to residents and visitors of Vancouver who are looking to find either type of commerce.

## Data Gathering

We started with data of the amenities in Vancouver contained in OpenStreetMap. We filtered through the data to keep only restaurants and fast food places. We identified many chain restaurants by using internet data on most popular franchases and comparing it with OpenStreetMap  for lists of restaurant franchises, and decided that all restaurants with a “brand” in their tags should also be included as a chain.
